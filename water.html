					<h2>Causes</h2>
					
					<p class="text-dark">Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. 
					It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. 
					Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Marine</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Marine pollution is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean. 
						This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide.</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Industrial Wastewater</h3>
						<p class="text-dark card-text">Waste water from manufacturing or chemical processes in industries contributes to water pollution. 
						Industrial waste water usually contains specific and readily identifiable chemical compounds. 
						Water pollution is concentrated within a few subsectors, mainly in the form of toxic wastes and organic pollutants.</p>

						</div>
					
						<h3 class="text-dark">Agriculture</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Agriculture is a major contributor to water pollution from nonpoint sources. The use of fertilizers as well as surface runoff from farm fields, pastures and feedlots leads 
						to nutrient pollution. In addition to plant-focused agriculture, fish-farming is also a source of pollution. Additionally, agricultural runoff often contains high levels of pesticides.</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">On Environment</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">
							In order to thrive, healthy ecosystems rely on a complex web of animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi—all of which interact, directly or indirectly, with each other. 
							Harm to any of these organisms can create a chain effect, imperilling entire aquatic environments. 
							<br>
							<br>
							When water pollution causes an algal bloom in a lake or marine environment, the proliferation of newly introduced nutrients stimulates plant and algae growth, 
							which in turn reduces oxygen levels in the water. This dearth of oxygen, known as eutrophication, suffocates plants and animals and can create “dead zones,” 
							where waters are essentially devoid of life. In certain cases, these harmful algal blooms can also produce neurotoxins that affect wildlife, from whales to sea turtles.
							<br>
							<br>
							Chemicals and heavy metals from industrial and municipal wastewater contaminate waterways as well. These contaminants are toxic to aquatic life—most often reducing an organism’s life span and 
							ability to reproduce—and make their way up the food chain as predator eats prey. That’s how tuna and other big fish accumulate high quantities of toxins, such as mercury. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Marine ecosystems are also threatened by marine debris, which can strangle, suffocate, and starve animals. Much of this solid debris, such as plastic bags and soda cans, 
							get swept into sewers and storm drains and eventually out to sea, turning our oceans into trash soup and sometimes consolidating to form floating garbage patches. 
							Discarded fishing gear and other types of debris are responsible for harming more than 200 different species of marine life.

						<h3 class="text-dark">On Human Health</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Drinking or using polluted water can result in health problems, such as digestive issues, toxicity and death, or chronic toxicity and neurological issues from more serious 
						chemical pollution. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Waterborne pathogens are the most common cause of illness in humans from polluted water. Diseases from the consumption of contaminated water include giardia, typhoid, and 
						cholera. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Accidental and illegal leaks from sewage facilities and runoff from urban areas and agriculture farms occur even in wealthy nations, affecting everyone’s water quality. 
						In fact, every year, the United Nations reports that 85,700 children die from diarrhea caused by contaminated water.

						<h3 class="text-dark">Water Treatment</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it appropriate for a specific end-use. 
						The end use may be drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being safely returned to the environment. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Water treatment removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use. 
						This treatment is crucial to human health and allows humans to benefit from both drinking and irrigation use.
						</p>

						</div>
					
						<h3 class="text-dark">Industrial Wastewater Treatment</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Industrial wastewater treatment describes the processes used for treating wastewater that is produced by industries as an undesirable by-product. 
						After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) may be reused or released to a sanitary sewer or to surface water in the environment. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that can be treated in sewage treatment plants. 
						Most industrial processes, such as petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants have their own specialized facilities to treat their wastewaters 
						so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the regulations regarding the disposal of wastewaters into sewers or into rivers, lakes or oceans. 
						<br>
						<br>
						This applies to industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), 
						toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia.
						Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove some pollutants (e.g., toxic compounds), and then discharge the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system.
						</p>

						</div>
					
						<h3 class="text-dark">Agricultural Wastewater Treatment</h3>
						<p class="text-dark">Agricultural wastewater treatment is a farm management agenda for controlling pollution from confined animal operations and from surface runoff that may be contaminated by 
						chemicals in fertilizer, pesticides, animal slurry, crop residues or irrigation water. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Agricultural wastewater treatment is required for continuous confined animal operations like milk and egg production. 
						It may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units similar to those used for industrial wastewater. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Where land is available for ponds, settling basins and facultative lagoons may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding or harvest cycles.
						Animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. 
						Constructed wetlands are sometimes used to facilitate the treatment of animal wastes.
